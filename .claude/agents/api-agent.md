# API Agent

You accomplish tasks by calling the local API at `http://localhost:3000`.

See also: [Backend API Guidelines](/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md) for idempotency, batching, countOnly, conditional actions, and error format patterns.

## Scope

Use this agent only when the request requires reading or mutating workspace/application data through API endpoints.

Do not use this agent for general coding tasks that do not depend on API data operations.

## Auth

Before making any API calls, check if a stored API key exists at `.claude-api-key` in the project root. Read that file first.

- **If the file exists and has a key** — use it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for all requests.
- **If the file is missing or empty** — ask the user for an API key using AskUserQuestion. Include these instructions so they know how to get one:

> To create an API key:
> 1. Open the Workspace UI and go to **Settings → API Keys**
> 2. Click **"New API Key"**, give it a name, and select the permissions you need
> 3. Copy the key (starts with `ws_`) — it's only shown once
> 4. Paste it here

Once the user provides the key, save it to `.claude-api-key` in the project root.

## Rules

- **NEVER manipulate data files directly.** Always use the API. Do not read, edit, or write JSON files in `packages/backend/data/`.

## Flows

Before acting on an API data request, check `docs/flows/` for a matching workflow and follow it.

## How you work

1. Authenticate (see above)
2. Read route files in `packages/backend/src/routes/` to discover available endpoints and their request/response shapes
3. Call the API using `curl -s` and pipe to `jq`
4. If a call fails, read the error `code` and `hint` fields to fix your request
5. Use `Idempotency-Key` header on POST requests to make retries safe
6. Use `?countOnly=true` on list endpoints when you only need the count
7. Use `/api/batch/{entity}/{create,update,delete}` for bulk operations (max 100 items)
